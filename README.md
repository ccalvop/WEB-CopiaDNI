# WEB-CopiaDNI

*Read this in: [English](README.md), [Spanish](README_ES.md)*

**CopiaDNI** is a secure web application for processing identity documents with a privacy-first approach, built with Node.js and hosted on a Ubuntu minimal virtual machine with CloudPanel.io. This application allows users to process identity document images securely by converting them to black and white and adding customizable watermarks. All processing occurs locally in the user's browser, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

## Infrastructure & Technology Stack

At its core, this web application is built primarily with JavaScript, leveraging modern web development technologies. The application uses JavaScript both for the user interface (frontend) and the server (backend), which is made possible through Node.js. This unified approach to development, using a single programming language throughout the entire application, significantly streamlines development and maintenance. **In the frontend**, React serves as the main framework for building the user interface, providing a smooth and responsive experience. This is complemented by Tailwind CSS, which provides ready-to-use styles and designs. **On the backend**, Node.js acts as the bridge that allows JavaScript to run on the server side. Node.js enables us to use JavaScript throughout the entire application. Express.js, building on top of Node.js, simplifies common server tasks like serving files to browsers. **The application** is hosted on a cloud virtual machine (instance) running Ubuntu Minimal as the operating system. The Node.js application runs and is managed by PM2, a process manager that ensures continuous operation and provides automatic restart capabilities. CloudPanel.io serves as a web control panel to facilitate server administration.

### Why Node.js?

Node.js was chosen as the foundation for this web application for these reasons:

- **JavaScript Ecosystem**: Node.js allows using JavaScript both on the client and server side, providing a unified language throughout the application stack. This enables seamless development and maintenance.
- **Performance**: Node.js's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it particularly efficient for serving web applications, especially those handling concurrent connections.
- **Rich Package Ecosystem**: Access to npm (Node Package Manager) provides a vast library of open-source packages and tools that accelerate development.
- **Modern Development**: Integration with current development tools and practices, including React for frontend development and Express.js for backend services.

The complete technology stack includes:

### Frontend Development
- **React 18**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that offers faster development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

### Backend & Server
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for serving static files
- **PM2**: Process manager for Node.js applications in production

## Core Architecture Overview

To provide a better understanding of the application's architecture, this repository includes a [core.js](core.js) file that demonstrates the fundamental structure and flow of the application. This file serves as a technical documentation that illustrates how different components interact within the system.

The architecture overview in `core.js` reflects the actual implementation distributed across the project's components, showing how the application manages image processing, user interface interactions, and security measures. It provides insights into the state management, component hierarchy, and processing pipeline without exposing sensitive implementation details.

The architectural representation demonstrates several key aspects of the system:

## How It Works

The application follows a secure, client-side processing workflow:

1. **Document Upload**: Users can upload document images through their browser
2. **Local Processing**: Images are processed entirely in the client's browser:
   - Conversion to black and white
   - Application of custom watermark
   - No data transmission to external servers
3. **Download**: Processed images are immediately available for download
4. **Privacy**: No images or data are stored or transmitted

## Privacy & Security

The application prioritizes user privacy and security through:

- Client-side processing of all images
- No server-side storage of documents
- SSL/TLS encryption for all connections
- Regular security updates and maintenance
